# Introduction

Imagine you‚Äôre tasked with building a cool new feature for a product. You dive into the work with full energy, and just
before the deadline, you manage to finish it. Everyone loves your work, and the feature is set to go live the next day.
A few days later, you receive an email from a user who can‚Äôt access the new feature. The user points out that they don‚Äôt
understand what the button does. What do they mean? You review your code, locate the button, and start digging into the
problem.

```html

<button>
  <i class="icon">üìÜ</i>
</button>
```

# The Problem

You find some good resources explaining that there are people with disabilities who need to be considered in these
cases. This is known as accessibility. For example, some individuals have motor impairments and cannot use a mouse. In
this particular case, the user is visually impaired and relies on assistive technology like a screen reader, which reads
aloud the content of the website or software. The button you implemented doesn‚Äôt have any descriptive text, so only the
icon is read aloud. In your case, the screen reader says, ‚ÄúTear-Off Calendar button‚Äù. While it describes the appearance
of the icon, it doesn‚Äôt convey the purpose of the button. This information is meaningless to the user. A button should
always describe what action it will trigger when activated. That‚Äôs why we need additional descriptive text.

# The Challenge

Okay, you understand the problem now and agree that it should be fixed. However, you don‚Äôt want to add visible text to
the button. For design and aesthetic reasons, sighted users should only see the icon. Is there a way to keep the button
‚Äúicon-only‚Äù while still providing a meaningful, descriptive text for users who rely on assistive technologies like
screen readers?

# The Solution

In HTML, you are allowed to use specific attributes for accessibility, and in this case, the attribute **aria-label** is
what
you need. ARIA stands for ‚ÄúAccessible Rich Internet Applications‚Äù and is an initiative to make websites and software
more accessible to people with disabilities.

With **aria-label**, you can assign a descriptive, accessible text to a button without it being visible to sighted
users.
The purpose of **aria-label** is to provide a description for interactive elements that lack a visible label or
descriptive
text. All you need to do is add the attribute **aria-label** to the button.

![Code snippet showing a button element with an accessible aria-label attribute set to "Open calendar". The button contains an icon with a calendar emoji.](./button-with-name.png)

```html

<button aria-label="Open Calendar">
  <i class="icon">üìÜ</i>
</button>
```

With this adjustment, the screen reader will now announce ‚ÄúOpen calendar‚Äù, completely ignoring the icon. This clearly
communicates to the user what the button will do when clicked.
